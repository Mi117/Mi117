- 👋Greetings to all the community! 🙋‍♂️ 
- 🤝 I am deeply humbled to start this educational journey and become an active force for a better world 🗺️
- 🤓 My name's Michele ITA/AUS _ @Mi117
- 👀 I have profound interest in software development, Front-End design and Cybersecurity focus
- 🌱 I have started to learn the basics of Computational Languages (HTML, CSS, Javascript and Phyton), while strenghtening my knowledge about Cybersecurity practices on my path to become a SOC Analyst and Penetration Tester.
- 💞️ I'm looking to reach a good level of knowledge to be able to collaborate on projects (at a basic entry-level, intially) in order to achieve hands-on experience on the field and sharpen my skills while acquiring new ones along the way.
